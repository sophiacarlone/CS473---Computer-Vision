# Part 1
## Question 1
We think that inverting translation means that we are going in the negative direction intended. <br>
The matrix would be:

```math
M_T^{-1} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & -t_x \\
0 & 1 & -t_y \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
```

## Question 2
We think that inverting rotation means that we are flipping the sign for Theta. Because of the properties of cosine and sine, only sine will show a switch in the sign. <br>
The matrix would be:

```math
M_R^{-1} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos{\theta} & -\sin{\theta} & 0 \\
\sin{\theta} & \cos{\theta} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
```

## Question 3
The inverse of a reflection is the original state of the matrix. To get back to the original state of the matrix, all that is needed is to apply the reflection matrix again. Since the reflection matrix applies -1 on the coordinates, applying -1 again will cancel it out. 

## Question 4
The inverse of a shear is a shear to place it back to the original image.
 <br>
The matrix would be:

```math
M_{S_x}^{-1} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & r_x\\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} ^{-1}
= 
\frac{1}{(1)(1)-(r_x)(0)}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -(r_x)\\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -r_x\\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
```
<br>
For the y direction, everything would be the same, except that the -$`r_x`$ on the top right and the 0 on the bottom left would be switched: 

```math
M_{S_y}^{-1} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0\\
-r_y & 1
\end{bmatrix}
```

# Part 2
Each image generated by out code is contained in the Images/ folder. Following are the matrices used and other steps taken for each part of the assignment. To compute the transformed image, the image matrix, I, the transform matrix, A, and the type of transformation (as a string) we used as arguments for the function transformImage( InputImage, TransformationMatrix, TransformType ).

## Question 1

```math
A = \begin{bmatrix}
    1920/L & 0 & 0\\
    0 & 1080/W & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix},
    \text{ where }L\text{ and }W\text{ are the length and width of the image.}
```

## Question 2

```math
A = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0\\
    0 & -1 & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
```

## Question 3

```math
A = \begin{bmatrix}
    \cos{30} & -\sin{30} & 0\\
    \sin{30} & \cos{30} & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
```

## Question 4

```math
A = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0.5 & 0\\
    0 & 1 & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
```

## Question 5
We used the composition of three different matrices:

```math
A_s = \begin{bmatrix}
    0.5 & 0 & 0\\
    0 & 0.5 & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
```

```math
A_t = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 300\\
    0 & 1 & 500\\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
```

```math
A_r = \begin{bmatrix}
    \cos{-20} & -\sin{20} & 0\\
    \sin{-20} & \cos{-20} & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
```

So, $`A=A_s*A_t*A_r`$, and we used the inv() function in MATLAB to find the inverse matrix.

## Question 6
Affine transformations worked normally with the regular functions implemented.

## Question 7
Homographies work similarly to Affine transformations. To get them to work, however, when finding cornersprime, the w value in the third row was able to change. To account for this, the first two columns are divided by their corresponding w value. To ensure each value is still an integer, the ceiling was taken of the matrix. Then, the subsequent operations worked smoothly.
