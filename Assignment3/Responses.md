Using the images of the checkerboard, we found

\[
    K_checker=\begin{bmatrix}
        2.8345\text{e}+03 & 0 & 1.5047\text{e}+03 \\
        0 & 2.8358\text{e}+03 & 1.9654\text{e}+03 \\
        0 & 0 & 1 \\
    \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Additionally, we estimated that

\[
    K=\begin{bmatrix}
        2.6495\text{e}+03 & -1.0324\text{e}+03 & -3.8967\text{e}+03 \\  
        0 & 1.1764\text{e}+03 & 3.2343\text{e}+03 \\
        0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}.
\]

We figured the error in our estimated K came from both the fact that K is an estimate from only 6 points. Additionally, since we choose the points on both images, there may be some human error in the exact locations of points we chose on both the image and the object.

K has worse quality than Kchecker. This may be due the estimates for K are less accurate as they are more likely to face human error.
